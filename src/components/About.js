        <p>
          Hi! I'm Sanjana Bamnavat, a 3rd-year BTech student specializing in CSEAI at IGDTUW. 
          I am a passionate developer and designer with over 1.5 years of experience in UI/UX design. 
          My journey involves crafting creative solutions for both web and mobile applications, blending 
          technical skills with a strong aesthetic sense. When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring design trends 
          and creating innovative user experiences.
